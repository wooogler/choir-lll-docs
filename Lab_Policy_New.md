# Conference Travel Funding Policies

Lifelong Learning Lab typically provides funding for first-authors of papers to travel to conferences. If a student does not have a paper, travel funding is considered on a case-by-case basis. The Rackham Graduate School offers a travel grant that can cover a significant portion of travel expenses, and the amount varies depending on the location. To be eligible for a Rackham travel grant, students must be enrolled at the time of application. Students are advised to check the Rackham website for specific details. Additionally, serving as a student volunteer at a conference can sometimes result in funding from the conference itself. Some conferences, such as SIGCHI, offer travel grants. If a student has not published in a year but is making satisfactory progress in their research, there may be discussions about funding opportunities to attend a conference to facilitate networking with other researchers.

# Cognate Equivalency Procedure

- To add information about the steps for cognate equivalency, follow these procedures: Students must first consult with their advisor to determine which class can be taken for equivalency. The advisor is responsible for sending an email to the CSE graduate staff at csegradstaff@umich.edu. The email should request the review and approval of the cognate equivalency case, including details about the course and the student, as well as a link to the course syllabus. The CSE staff will review the request and forward the necessary information to Rackham. Students are required to submit their official transcripts for the class to Rackham at racketranscripts@umich.edu before the equivalency request can be processed.

# Stipend and Salary Disbursement Schedule

- At Lifelong Learning Lab, the disbursement schedule for stipends and salaries is as follows: Graduate Student Research Assistant (GSRA) salaries are disbursed at the end of the month. Fellowship and scholarship stipends are disbursed in the middle of the month, typically around the 20th.

# Slack Workspace Membership Process

- The Lifelong Learning Lab has established a process for inviting individuals to become members of its Slack workspace. This process is essential for ensuring that communication within the organization is streamlined and that only authorized members have access to workspace resources. Membership in the Slack workspace indicates a commitment to collaboration and engagement within the lab's community. It is important for all members to familiarize themselves with the guidelines and expectations associated with being part of the Slack workspace.
