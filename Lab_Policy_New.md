# Conference Travel Funding Policies

Lifelong Learning Lab typically provides funding for first-authors of papers to travel to conferences. If a student does not have a paper, travel funding is considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Rackham Graduate School Travel Grant
The Rackham Graduate School offers a travel grant that can cover a significant portion of travel expenses, and the amount varies depending on the location. Students are advised to check the Rackham website for specific details.

## Student Volunteer Opportunities
Additionally, serving as a student volunteer at a conference can sometimes result in funding from the conference itself. Some conferences, such as SIGCHI, offer travel grants.

## Funding for Non-Published Students
If a student has not published in a year but is making satisfactory progress in their research, there may be discussions about funding opportunities to attend a conference to facilitate networking with other researchers.
