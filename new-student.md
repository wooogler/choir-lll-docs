# First Year of Your PhD

## What to Expect During Your First Year

Everyone‚Äôs journey will be different, but here are common areas to navigate during your first year. Be sure to consult the [CSE Graduate Program Guide](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-advising/forms-and-processes/) for full policies.

> **Note**: Do **not enroll in Spring/Summer terms** unless you are defending and graduating in that term.  
> Questions? Contact the Graduate Programs Office at [csegradstaff@umich.edu](mailto:csegradstaff@umich.edu)

---

## An Advisor

Your goal during your first year is to identify a **research advisor** with whom you have a strong working relationship.  
This advisor will help guide your research and coursework. Some students also work with **co-advisors**.

---

## Directed Study and Research Potential

You must demonstrate research potential by enrolling in **CSE/EECS 699 (Directed Study)**:

- Minimum **2 credit hours** required before your **Preliminary Exam**
- **At least 1 credit** must be taken within your **first two terms**
- If admitted **before Fall 2023** ‚Üí **3 credits** required
- If admitted **Fall 2023 or later** ‚Üí **2 credits** + **EECS 601 (1 credit)**

> ‚ùå CSE/EECS 599 (Directed Study) does **not** count toward Ph.D. qualification requirements.

---

## Responsible Conduct of Research and Scholarship (RCRS)

You must complete RCRS training, which includes:

- Four required **in-person workshops**
- Online training through **PEERRS** in *My LINC*

> RCRS completion is a **Rackham candidacy requirement**.  
> Complete **before** your preliminary exam.

---

## Required Coursework Categories

You‚Äôll complete coursework in the following three categories:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Breadth** | 3 courses in different technical areas (Hardware, AI, Software, Theory, HCC). Requires **B+ or higher**. Equivalency possible. |
| **Depth** | 2 advanced courses in a focused research area. Requires **A- or higher**. **Equivalency not allowed**. |
| **Cognate** | 3+ credit graduate-level course **outside CSE**, approved by advisor. Must not duplicate CSE content. |

Refer to the [CSE Ph.D. Course List](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-advising/forms-and-processes/) for qualifying courses.

---

## CSE 601 ‚Äì Introduction to Graduate Research

All first-year Ph.D. students are required to take **CSE 601 (1 credit)** in the **first fall term**.

**Topics include:**

- Promoting your research
- Building a positive advisor relationship
- Publishing in CS venues
- Teaching and community involvement

> üí¨ This course also connects you with your incoming cohort and the broader research community.

---

## Breadth Course Equivalency Requests

If you‚Äôve taken graduate courses elsewhere, you may request equivalency:

1. Fill out the [CSE Course Equivalency Form](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-advising/forms-and-processes/)
2. Gather supporting materials (syllabus, sample work, etc.)
3. Get approval from:
   - The instructor of the equivalent U-M course (use [Atlas](https://atlas.ai.umich.edu))
   - Your advisor
4. Submit to the **Graduate Programs Office** via email

> ‚úÖ For Machine Learning equivalency, reference **CSE 545** (not EECS 553).

---

## Cognate Course Equivalency Requests

For graduate courses taken outside CSE:

- Provide your transcript to Rackham
- Your advisor must email GPO with:
  - Course description
  - Credit hours
  - Why it fulfills Rackham‚Äôs cognate requirement

If approved, you, your advisor, and GPO will receive confirmation from Rackham.

---
## Cognate Course Equivalency Request

You can also satisfy the cognate requirement via an **equivalency request**. However, this policy differs slightly because it requires **Rackham approval**.

If you have completed **non-CSE graduate-level coursework** at an **accredited graduate-degree-granting institution**, you may ask your advisor to approve:

- Up to **3 credit hours** (semester calendar), or  
- Up to **5 credit hours** (trimester calendar)

This coursework may be used to fulfill **Rackham‚Äôs cognate requirement**.

### Steps to Request Cognate Equivalency:

1. Submit the **final, official transcript** from the other institution to the **Rackham Graduate School**, even if no degree was awarded.
2. Your **advisor must email** the **Graduate Programs Office**:  
   [csegradstaff@umich.edu](mailto:csegradstaff@umich.edu)
   - The email should request that a **specific graduate-level course** (include **course name and number**) be used *‚Äúin spirit‚Äù* to satisfy the Rackham cognate requirement.
3. The **Graduate Coordinator** will forward the request to **Rackham‚Äôs Academic Records and Dissertations** office.
4. If approved, **Rackham** will send confirmation to:
   - The Graduate Coordinator
   - Your advisor
   - You (the student)

---

## First Spring/Summer ‚Äì Residency and Internships

During your **first spring/summer semester** in the Ph.D. program, you are **required to remain in Ann Arbor** and conduct **independent research** in collaboration with a CSE faculty member.

> üéØ The goal is to ensure students are actively engaged in research at Michigan in preparation for their **preliminary exam** project.

---

### Internships (First-Year Students Only)

First-year Ph.D. students **may go on internships** only if the internship:

- Is **explicitly aligned** with the student‚Äôs research
- Supports their **preliminary exam project**

> **You must get GPO approval BEFORE accepting any internship offer.**

---

### Internship Petition Process

1. Student and advisor must file a **petition** (see Forms and Processes), including:
   - Internship **location**
   - **Dates** of the internship
   - **Hours per week**
   - **Supervisor**
   - Description of **work to be done**
   - Explanation of how the work relates to **prelim research** and its **importance**
   - Supporting documentation (optional but encouraged)

2. The petition will be **reviewed by the Graduate Programs Office**.
   - GPO may request additional information.
   - **Not all requests are approved.**

3. Submit the petition **early**, as review takes **1‚Äì2 weeks**.  
   - **Petitions cannot be expedited** to meet external deadlines.

### Important Note

This petition process **does not apply** to students who:

- Transfer from a **U-M CSE M.S. program** to the Ph.D. program
