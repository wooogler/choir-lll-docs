# $1.2 million NSF funding for U-M research on surgical training - September 20, 2024

## The researchers will apply computational methods to assess and enhance surgical training and patient outcomes.

Researchers at the University of Michigan, including CSE professors Xu Wang and Anhong Guo as well as Prof. Vitaliy Popov of Michigan Medicine, have received a $1.2 million grant from the NSF to support their research leveraging advanced computational methods to evaluate and improve surgical training. The project also involves senior personnel Dr. Brian George and Dr. Gurjit Sandhu of Michigan Medicine. Through their project, titled "Multimodal Techniques to Enhance Intra- and Post-operative Learning and Coordination between Attending and Resident Surgeons," they seek to deploy a multimodal modeling approach to assess and predict surgeon behaviors during operations with the aim of developing new educational tools for surgeons-in-training.

Surgeon training is an area of vital importance in the medical sector. Surgery requires a high degree of knowledge and precision, and the stakes of making a mistake are incredibly high; surgical errors can result in patient injury and even death. Despite these considerations, recent research has shown that many surgeons in the U.S. are not sufficiently trained when they complete their residencies, highlighting a need for more robust educational methods for surgeons.

To address this need, U-M researchers will adopt a computational approach to improve training experiences and outcomes for learning surgeons. Their work will build upon the team's previous projects evaluating surgeons' visual needs during surgery, which received a Best Paper Honorable Mention Award at CHI 2024, and designing a video-based surgical training tool called Surgment, which was spearheaded by CSE PhD student Jingying Wang and also presented at CHI 2024.

The first step will be to observe and model attending and resident surgeons' behaviors in the operating room. This will involve performing a detailed assessment of approximately 100 laparoscopic gallbladder removal surgeries, with data collected on surgeons' gaze during surgery, conversations that occur in the operating room, and a video stream of the surgery obtained by the laparoscopic camera.

This examination will equip the team with robust data that will allow them to better understand and predict surgeon behavior and, by extension, the competence and independence of resident surgeons as well as the quality of instruction given by attending surgeons. Their predictive modeling approach will include a scene segmentation pipeline that automatically interprets and annotates surgery scenes (as demonstrated in Surgment), as well as a neural network architecture that will enable the researchers to simultaneously derive insight from multiple data streams—gaze, audio, and video.

Armed with this information, the team aims to develop an interactive dashboard that surgeons can use after an operation to debrief, review key moments from surgery, and deliver instructional feedback. They plan to test this postoperative dashboard in controlled experiments to determine its effectiveness in improving instruction and competence in the operating room. The team will also develop and evaluate augmented reality-based intraoperative visualizations to enhance coordination and instruction.

Through these innovative computational techniques and educational tools, the researchers aim to bridge existing gaps in surgical training, improving the readiness and independence of resident surgeons and, in the process, enhancing patient safety.

"We're excited about the potential this research holds for transforming surgical training," said Wang. "By leveraging advanced computational methods and partnerships with Michigan Medicine, we can gain unprecedented insights into surgeon behaviors and use this information to create more effective training tools, ultimately making surgeries safer for patients."

# NSF funds U-M research on generative AI in STEM education - December 15, 2023

## Prof. Xu Wang of CSE and Prof. Ying Xu of the School of Education have received an NSF award to support their research on teacher-AI collaboration to develop STEM educational resources.

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has created transformational changes in education, as well as unprecedented opportunities. Harnessing the new abilities afforded by this rapidly developing technology will require buy-in from educators to work with generative AI (GenAI) and help guide its use in reshaping learning, particularly in STEM.

To this end, researchers at the University of Michigan, including Prof. Xu Wang of Computer Science and Engineering and Prof. Ying Xu of the School of Education, have received $200,000 in funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to explore how teachers can collaborate with AI and leverage the abilities of LLMs to design and enhance video-based STEM learning. Their project, titled "Empowering Teachers to Collaborate with Generative AI for Developing High-Quality STEM Learning Resources," is being supported by the NSF Directorate for STEM Education as part of their recent call for Rapid Response Research on the use of AI in classrooms.

"It is important that teachers – who are at the forefront of daily student interaction and possess indispensable knowledge and expertise – go beyond being mere consumers to key contributors.," said Wang. "Our aim is to leverage the rapidly developing powers of AI to make positive changes in the classroom."

In partnership with the WGBH Educational Foundation, which hosts PBSLearningMedia, a video-based STEM education platform with millions of users, the research team will collaborate with teachers in the PBSLearning network to create intelligent tutors to accompany the learning resources on the platform.

In creating the intelligent tutors, teachers will collaborate with Large Language Models (LLMs). Teachers will have direct oversight of and ability to tailor the tutor's questions and feedback through prompting LLMs to generate desirable outputs according to their instructional goals and the needs of their students.

The resulting intelligent tutors will then guide students as they learn from the videos, periodically asking students questions to test their comprehension and providing custom feedback throughout the lesson.

"The goal is in no way to replace teachers," said Wang, "but to add a useful, customizable resource to their arsenal that can further support their teaching objectives and enhance the learning experience for their students."

The evaluation phase of the project will involve testing the feasibility and efficacy of the intelligent tutors, both in terms of student and teacher experience and technical performance. The researchers will also propose specific design strategies to ensure that teachers and others without technical expertise have significant input in the development of AI-based educational resources.

For Wang, this work is a critical step in making AI more transparent and accessible. "We hope to show that AI can be a powerful and easy-to-use tool in the classroom," said Wang. "And we want to empower teachers to embrace this technology and tailor it to their needs."

# NSF funds U-M initiative leveraging AI to teach students essay writing - November 28, 2023

## The $850k grant will support a multidisciplinary initiative to use large language models as writing assistants for students.

The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has fueled broad public anxiety surrounding their use to substitute human input. One arena in which this concern has been particularly salient is education, with students increasingly relying on ChatGPT and the like to complete exams, papers, and other assignments and few mechanisms in place to police this activity.

But what if LLMs could be used to help students become better writers, instead of writing their essays for them? Researchers at University of Michigan, including Profs. Lu Wang and Xu Wang in Computer Science and Engineering, seek to answer this question by exploring LLMs' ability to augment students' argumentative writing skills. Their team has received an $850,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support their project, titled "Argument Graph Supported Multi-Level Approach for Argumentative Writing Assistance."

"We hope to show that LLMs can be a tool, instead of just a threat, in the classroom," said Lu Wang.

Specifically, the researchers aim to create an LLM-based sandbox for students to practice and receive instant feedback on their writing.

"Traditionally, it could take days or even weeks for students to receive feedback on their writing, revise, resubmit, and so on," said Xu Wang. "LLMs such as ChatGPT show the potential of reducing feedback cycles and saving instructors' time in doing repetitive work so that they can spend more meaningful time with individual students."

To test LLMs' capacity for such assistance, the researchers will build and test a prototype system called ArguAble, which uses AI to help students practice and enhance their argumentative writing. This program will include novel natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to ensure adequate understanding and measurement of writing quality. They will also implement a feedback provision and revision suggestion system to help students edit and improve their writing in real time.

"ArguAble provides students with the space to practice their writing with scaffolding activities that build upon each other and help them develop their skills," said Lu Wang.

ArguAble will be implemented and evaluated in several classes at U-M, including introductory engineering courses, first-year writing classes, and other classes in which technical or argumentative writing is a focus.

In addition to helping students develop important writing skills that will support their academic success, the researchers hope that their work will shed new light on AI's ability to serve as a learning tool.

"We aim to show how natural language processing can help us develop efficient and scalable approaches for teaching argumentative writing," said Lu Wang. "More broadly, we hope our research will demonstrate how AI can help further, instead of hamper, educational goals."
