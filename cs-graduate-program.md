## 1. Overview of the CSE Graduate Programs

At the Graduate Level: All graduate CSE degrees are offered under the rules of the [Rackham School of Graduate Studies](https://rackham.umich.edu). This document covers the CSE graduate degree programs – the master’s degree program and the doctoral degree program.

The CSE Graduate Committee is the governing committee for all CSE academic degrees and students. The CSE graduate programs fall under the [College of Engineering (CoE)](https://engin.umich.edu) Honor Code.

---

### 1.1 M.S./M.S.E. Degree Program in Computer Science and Engineering

Both the regular master’s degree and Sequential Undergraduate/Graduate Studies (SUGS) master’s degree program are administered by the Computer Science and Engineering division of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

**Regular:** This means that the Master’s program does **not** continue on to the Ph.D. program automatically — students are required to apply separately to be admitted to the CSE doctoral program.

- Students who earned a **bachelor’s degree in engineering**, either from Michigan or another institution, may elect either an **MS** or **MSE** degree.
- Students who earned an **undergraduate degree in a non-engineering field** are eligible to earn an **MS** degree.

Application procedures and the principal requirements for the M.S.E. and M.S. degree programs are described in detail on [CSE’s website](https://cse.engin.umich.edu).

#### 1.1.1 Satisfying Degree Requirements

To complete the CSE graduate programs outlined in this document, a student must:

- Fulfill all course requirements;
- Complete required coursework at a level which meets departmental grade requirements and competency areas;
- Satisfy the regulations of the [Rackham School of Graduate Studies](https://rackham.umich.edu);
- Adhere to policies outlined by the [College of Engineering](https://engin.umich.edu).

---

### 1.2 Ph.D. Degree Program in Computer Science and Engineering

The doctoral degree in Computer Science and Engineering is conferred by the Rackham Graduate School in recognition of:

- Marked ability and scholarship in a relatively broad field of knowledge, and
- Demonstrated ability to carry out independent research yielding significant original results.

#### Stages of the Doctoral Program

The doctoral program proceeds in three stages:

1. **Qualification** (see Section 7.1)
2. **Candidacy** (both departmental and Rackham requirements must be met)
3. **Dissertation** (writing and defense of the dissertation)

> Candidacy signifies that course work is essentially completed and some research has been started. Successful completion and defense of the doctoral dissertation marks the completion of the requirements for the Ph.D. degree.


## 2. Internet Resources

The Rackham Student Handbook and the Engineering College Bulletin are among the numerous UM publications available online. 

The Rackham Student Handbook gives details about the Ph.D. degree requirements imposed by the Graduate School and should be consulted by all Ph.D. students, particularly in regard to questions about:

- Continuous enrollment
- Fees
- Cognates
- Etc.

All CSE/EECS course descriptions are available online via:

---

### 4.1 Fulfilling SUGS Degree Requirements

SUGS students must complete the same requirements as the [Regular M.S./M.S.E. Degree Program](#31-requirements-msmse-degree-program-regular-masters-degree) (see Section 3.1). A thesis is **optional**.

SUGS students will complete requirements in a slightly different manner (explained below).

---

#### 4.1.1 Enrollment Requirements

- Designed for completion in a **minimum of two terms**.
- Students must enroll in **18 Rackham graduate-level credits** during the program.
  - If completing in two terms, **must enroll in at least 9 credits per term** (full-time tuition).
  - Students can extend to a **third term** if needed.
- Students may bring in **up to 15 credits** total via:
  - **Double-counting** (up to 9 credits)
  - **Transfer** (up to 6 credits)

**Double-Counting Rules**:
- Only graduate-level courses approved for the CSE Master’s degree.
- Must be from **technical or free electives** in the BSE program.
- Credits can be split across courses (e.g., 3×4 credit courses = 12 total → use 9 max).

**Transfer Credit Rules**:
- Must not have been used toward the undergrad degree (e.g., for major, minor, core, honors, etc.).
- Must transfer at **original credit value**.
  - Example: two 3-credit courses = 6 credits (transferable).
  - Two 4-credit courses = 8 credits (can only transfer one).

---

#### 4.1.2 SUGS and GSI/GSRA

- GSIs: allowed to enroll in **6 credits minimum**, but still need **9 credits/term** to graduate in 2 terms.
- Dropping below 9 credits in **any term** disqualifies two-term completion.
  - Example: 8 credits in term 1 and 10 in term 2 → must enroll in a 3rd term.
- Students with GSI or GSRA roles often take a third semester due to workload.

> The Graduate Programs Office **cannot approve exemptions** to the two-term policy. Contact Rackham for petitions.

---

### 4.2 Academic Advising
