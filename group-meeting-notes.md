### 1/22 Meeting notes 

#### Process of using LLMs as writing assistants
- GroupPaper-LLMAssistance-ExpertNovice
- Compare novice and expert usage with writing 
- How is this perceived by learners? Is this cheating? Does it help you learn?
#### LLMs capabilities in answering assignments/question in higher ed coursework
#### Flat earth ideas in learning sciences 
- Learning styles 
- When graphics improve liking but not learning from online lessons (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212000921)
- Create new “personality quiz” to replace outdated NYT
- Why do you believe this is true?
