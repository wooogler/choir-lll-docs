# Communication and Meetings

## How would you describe your advising style? Does your approach vary over the course of a student's progress within their degree?

My goal is to help my students become independent researchers and support their learning and growth. To meet this goal, I will provide varying degree of support and guidance depending on the students' needs and their journey in the phd. At earlier stages in their phd, I'll provide more scaffolding and guidance on research projects, especially if the student wants to receive more scaffolding. Later on as the student becomes more mature and independent, I'll fade my guidance. I will adjust my advising style to best support the student's goal.

## What is the best way/technology for students to contact you? Are there time frames in which students should expect to hear from you?

The best way to find me is through the Lifelong Learning Lab's Slack channel. I often respond to messages in my slack workspace relatively quickly. I can also be reached by email. Or I also really like it when students stop by my office to ask questions :)

## How often do you plan to meet with students one-on-one (be as specific as possible, it's okay to describe multiple styles that may vary with student needs)? Is an agenda required? How long are meetings?

I make time for my students. As I stated above, my advising style will vary depending on the students' needs and goals. For example, at earlier stages in their phd, if the student wants, I'm happy to meet 1-1 more frequently. The default is a one hour 1-1 meeting per week. E.g., at brainstorming stages, and when we are still trying to converge at a direction, I'm happy to meet more often than that. Before paper deadlines, we may meet more often if there are more decisions to make. During the meeting, I expect to discuss updates the student has, and answer any questions the student may have. I often find having rough agendas useful for the meeting, so that we make sure we cover everything the student wants to discuss. I realize that sometimes students also want emotional support other than information support, so I'll try to make the most of the one hour time. If the meeting agenda doesn't last a whole hour, I'm happy to discuss other issues, e.g., give them career advice during this time. In addition to weekly 1-1 meetings, there are other channels that my students and myself could meet each other. E.g., we have a weekly group meeting, and there may be project meetings with other collaborators.

## Do you have regular group meetings? What does student participation look like in a group meeting?

Yes, we have regular group meetings weekly. The primary goal is for everyone to get together and build a community. There have been a couple of activities we have tried at group meetings: 1) For students to give updates on their research progress and sprint goals 2) Some students may give a presentation of their work and have a discussion 3) Watch academic talks and discuss talks and papers together I'm happy to explore other types of activities during group meetings in the future, e.g., practice talks, tutorial sessions, skill sharing, etc.

# Research and Teaching Expectations

## Describe your students' primary area(s) of responsibility and expectations (e.g., reading peer-reviewed literature, in-lab working hours, etc.).

I expect Ph.D. students to have ownership of the projects they are leading. I often expect a Ph.D. student to have one main project that's their thesis topic, and also play supporting roles on side projects if they want to. In my personal experience, I find having side projects help explore new interests and meet cool people. For the projects students lead, they lead every aspect of the research life cycle, e.g., articulate the research questions, plan a research program to answer those research questions, and rigorously evaluate whether the evidence they gathered are able to answer the research questions. I will provide guidance along the way.

## How do you decide authorship and/or authorship order?

Authorship will be decided based on the authors' intellectual contributions to the paper. I encourage a discussion to decide authorship among all contributing authors. In general, the student who is leading the project decides on the authorship order in consultation with all collaborators. I encourage students to be inclusive and fair, and be open to initiate such conversations.

## Do you ask students in your group to serve as a GSI over the course of their program?

I think it's useful for students to have GSI experience during their program for two reasons. 1) GSI experience may give them inspirations for problems to solve in the teaching and learning space. 2) GSI experience could prepare students for future teaching if they want to look for faculty positions afterwards. I encourage students to take on GSI positions after they pass their prelim exam.

## Do you have general expectations for graduation?

I expect the student to have in-depth understanding of the sub field they are focusing on in their Ph.D. I also expect the student to have definitive answers to the research questions they are answering or the problems they are solving. This often requires several rounds of evaluation and iterative design and development. I encourage students to not focus on quantity of publications. Quality and depth is the key.

## Are you supportive of your students going on internships? If so, is there a time of year that is best? How many internships can they do?

Yes. I did two internships during my Ph.D, and I benefited from the internships in multiple ways. 1) I think it's useful for students to get exposure to industrial research, which may help them make more informed decisions of their career paths. 2) I think it's also helpful for students to learn new skills and learn different ways of doing research. 3) It helps build connections with industry researchers. 4) Sometimes it may inspire new research directions and collaborations. 5) Deploying research projects in real-world settings and witnessing the production line in a company could be a valuable experience. I think it's the best to do internships after the student's main research topic is established. For example, after the student has passed prelim. I would also encourage the student to do internship over the summer instead of during semesters.

# Opportunities for Feedback

## How do you provide students with feedback regarding overall progress, research activities, etc.?

I'll provide feedback to students' work closely through our collaboration. E.g., during our 1-1 meetings or over Slack/Email. I'll also provide feedback to students at the end of each semester to reflect on our achievements and plan for the next. I'll also provide feedback through the annual review letter.

## How far in advance of a deadline should a student expect to provide written work for feedback, such as publication drafts?

I would like to see a mostly completed draft at least one week before the deadline. This gives us time to iterate on the draft before the deadline.

## How do you solicit feedback from your students?

I solicit regular feedback during 1-1 meetings. I may ask questions such as what do you think of the project. I'll create a safe and supportive environment for students to ask questions and share their feelings with me. At the end of each semester, I'll ask my students to collaboratively work on an anonymous review to give me feedback.

# Conference Attendance

## Which meetings do your students generally attend? What funding is available to attend these meetings?

CHI, CSCW, AIED, UIST, Learning@Scale. Generally, we provide funding to students who are first authors on publications. If the student doesn't have a first-author publication that year, I'll support them go to one conference of their choice that year. So that each student at least goes to one conference each year.

# Time Away from Campus

## Discuss expectations regarding vacations and time away from campus and how best to plan for them. What is the time-frame for notification regarding anticipated absences?

I encourage students to take vacations after a major deadline, or after a busy semester. I appreciate it if students discuss travel plans with me early on, especially if they are outside of these time periods. In general, we give students 2 weeks of vacation time in addition to holidays. For international students who may have visa complications, I'm happy to support them work remotely.

## Are there specific standard times that students in your group generally take vacation?

Usually students may choose to take time off after conference deadlines, or during the summer or winter break. However, it is sometimes tricky that the CHI deadline is usually the end of summer in mid-September, and the AIED and CSCW deadlines are usually mid-January till mid-February. If the students are submitting to these conferences, they may want to work around these constraints. E.g., early summer or early winter break would work better than late into the summer or winter break.

## What do you do to facilitate students taking time off (e.g., do you proactively encourage people to take vacation after major deadlines)?

Something I recently learn from a colleague was that he often shared his vacation photos in his team's Slack space, which might be a nudge for people to do similar things and take vacations. I haven't done very well on this in the past, but I plan to make my vacation time more visible to my students.

# Additional Information

Are there any additional points that you would like to share?
This mentoring plan is work-in-progress. I'm actively seeking information and resources on how to become a better mentor. I may update this document periodically as I learn new things and strategies to support my students. If there are any questions or suggestions, please reach out to me at xwanghci@umich.edu. I also welcome discussion on these matters as well.
